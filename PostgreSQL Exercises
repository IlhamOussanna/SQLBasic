# PostgreSQL Exercises
# I showcase proficiency in querying and analysing datasets using pgAdmin4. 
# The exercises cover various scenarios, the queries performed on the "employees" table. 
# Including filtering based on gender, salary ranges, department, hire dates, and aggregating data for meaningful insights.

WHERE Country != "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tr.Name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.Tracks tr
ON inv.TrackId = tr.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tr.Name AS track, ar.Name AS artist, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.artists ar
LEFT JOIN chinook.albbums al ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId

LEFT JOIN chinook.invoice_items inv ON tr.TrackId = inv.TrackId;


#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT tr.Name AS 'Track Name', al.Title AS 'Album Title', me.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks tr
JOIN chinook.Albums al ON al.AlbumId = tr.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types me ON me.MediaTypeId = tr.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g ON g.GenreId = tr.GenreId;

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
